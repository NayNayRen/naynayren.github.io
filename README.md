## About naynayren.github.io

This is the codebase for my portfolio/resume site. I'm a Junior Web Developer trying to make this a new career. It's a collection of little bits about me like:

- a return to school after 20+ years
- my 25+ years of work history
- some web projects made
- ways of contacting me
- and some love for my puppy

The stack used to build this portfolio is HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a carousel-like slider that's used for my projects called <a href="https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/">Glider.js</a>. I'm always tweaking or adding or updating and pushing to this build as my home base of sorts.

My logo above is linked to my actual site.
