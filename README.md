## About naynayren.github.io

This is the codebase for my portfolio/resume site. I'm a Junior Web Developer trying to make this a new career. It's a collection of little bits about me:

- from a return to school after 20 ish years
- to my 25+ years of work history
- some web projects made
- meens of contacting me
- and some love for my puppy

The stack used to build this portfolio is HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and a carousel-like slider that's used for my projects called <a href="https://nickpiscitelli.github.io/Glider.js/" target="_blank">Glider.js</a>. I'm always tweaking or adding or updating and pushing to this build as my home base of sorts.

My logo above is linked to my actual site.

## Projects

These projects also have their codebase kept here. They are viewable through the links, or through my Projects section of my personal site above.
