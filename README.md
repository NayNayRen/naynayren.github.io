## About naynayren.github.io

This is my portfolio/resume site. I am a web developer trying to get into this as a new career. The stack used here is HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and a carousel-like slider called Glider.js. I am always tweaking or adding or updating to this.

If you like or enjoy what you see, please feel free to contact me through my social medias or by email. If you're reading this, thank you for stopping by with intrigue as to what I've created.

Have a wonderful day. o/
