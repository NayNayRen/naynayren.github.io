## About naynayren.github.io

This is my portfolio/resume site. It's collection of a little about me, a return to school after 20-ish years, my work history, projects made, and meens of contact. I am a web developer trying to get into this as a new career. The stack used here is HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and a carousel-like slider called Glider.js. I am always tweaking or adding or updating to this.

If you like or enjoy what you see, please feel free to contact me. If you're reading this, thank you for stopping by with intrigue as to what I've created.

Have a wonderful day. o/
