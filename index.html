      <img class="profile-photo" src="img/me.jpeg" alt="">

      <p class="container-text">Greetings and hellos, thank you for taking interest in seeing what I've created here. I just wanted to introduce myself a little before you went on your way through the rest of my site. My name is <span
          class="container-text-colored">Nate Moscato</span>, to some, Nay Nay, which was homebrewed by my family, and grown into an alter title of mine.</p>
      <p class="container-text">My first resume website was original created in 2018 towards the end of my Associate's degree, parts and pieces of which can be seen reworked here. I am on a journey to grow my creativity in the ways of web design by
        producing manageable, cleanly written code, alongside responsive and intriguing websites. The sections covering my <span class="container-text-colored">Education</span> and <span class="container-text-colored">Projects</span> gives more on my
        schooling and creations.</p>
      <p class="container-text">After 22 years in restaraunts, I thought pursuing something new could be refreshing. A more in depth dive into that portion can be found down in my <span class="container-text-colored">Work</span> section if you'd
        like. My goal in this is to be successful at designing websites, plain and simple. Please take a moment to cruise through my site, check out what I have covered through my studies, see some of the projects I've created, read a little of my
        work history, and if you would like to <span class="container-text-colored">Contact</span> me, please do so through any means listed below. There is also a .pdf version of my resume if you're interested in that as well. It's located down with
          my media links.</p>

    <!-- EDUCATION -->
    <div class="container">
      <a id="education"></a>
      <h1>Back to the books...</h1>
      <p class="container-text">I returned to school in the Spring of 2016 and began taking classes at <a href="https://www.spcollege.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">St. Petersburg College</a>.
        I enrolled in the Computer Science program to learn how to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the creation of
        websites. The creativity of design, potential freedom of work schedule, possible income, and change of scenery is what grabbed my attention.
        <span class="container-square"></span>
      </p>
      <p class="container-text">So, after a little experimentaion, I switched my course track to accomidate Web Development. I had never
        done any kind of previous codeing. I gravitated towards the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a solid field to get into.
        Every business needs a website right? After two and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a full time work one,
        I finished my Associate in Science and a degree in Web Development. Now I pursue it as a new career while still learning this new craft.</p>

      <p class="container-text">So here are a handful of projects that I've built. Page down through each slide, and if you'd like to visit each build, just click the picture. These are school and personal builds that I thought would be a nice

      <h1>My history of work...</h1>
      <p class="container-text">I have 24 years in the restaurant industry, most of which was served with the same company. Back when I started in restaurants, I was bussing tables for the first four years of my young hospitality life. After a fluke
        of someone calling in sick one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the kitchen. I quickly learned all the skills needed, and memorized every recipe n order for me to advance through the ranks.<span
          class="container-square"></span></p>
      <p class="container-text">Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten years later I was awarded the first of three kitchens directly under my management. My last stop was
        Sarasota, then I returned to the Tampa Bay area and went back to school, attending St. Petersburg College.</p>
      <p class="container-text">I am currently into my first proffesional development role with <a href="https://pennexx.net/" class="link">Pennexx Foods</a> as one of their Front-End Web Developers. I've been with them since the end of April 2021. I
