          and progressing as a <span class="blue-text">Web Developer</span> for
          a little over two years now. I most recently tried getting into more
          of the back end concepts, mainly Laravel and what that framework has
          in hiding. In doing so, I hope to merge both front and back ends to
          produce solid full stack potential.

          to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the

          thought about doing, any kind of previous coding. I gravitated towards
          the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a
          solid field to get into. Everybody needs a website right? After two
          and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a
          full time work one, I finished my
          <span class="blue-text">Associate in Science</span> and a

          used it in a project. It's extremely lightweight with smooth
          transitions, and very mobile friendly. It's not a true carousel as it
          doesn't have infinate looping, but it is a fantastic alternative.

                This is my first build as a professional Web Developer while I
                was employed by a local marketing group. It started off as an
                experiment in building it using only a front end stack of HTML,
                CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as a one-user application for
                testing. I was then tasked to rebuild it but adding PHP. This
                led me to Laravel, and my intro to a back end framework. This
                also introduced me to the use of phpMyAdmin, MySQL, model view
                controller (MVC), Blade Templates, Ajax, Google Maps API, and a
                re-introduction to jQuery. A lot of what was just mentioned
                above was a first time use for me.

                An issue I faced after installing Ubuntu and Mint where Pulse
                Audio would sleep after a short time of silence. When the volume
                was adjusted or audio started, the speakers would crack and pop
                briefly. This is a short walkthrough I did to help stop that.

          I have <span class="blue-text">24 years</span> in the restaurant
          industry, most of which was served with the same company. Back when I
          started in restaurants, I was bussing tables for the first four years
          of my young hospitality life. After a fluke of someone calling in sick
          one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the
          kitchen. I quickly learned all the skills needed, and memorized every
          recipe in order for me to smash through the ranks.

          Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different
          locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten years later, I was
          awarded the first kitchen directly under my management. This first
          stop in my management role was at the
          <span class="blue-text">Brandon, Florida</span> location. My staff and
          I proceeded to set record numbers in multiple categories for the next
          five years while I was there.

          My last stop was
          <span class="blue-text">Sarasota, Florida</span>, where my staff and I
          again set record numbers for the next two years. While doing so, we
          were also a food test kitchen, and one of the top "Manager in
          Training" locations. After two and a half years, I returned to the
          Tampa Bay area and decided to go back to school, attending St.
          Petersburg College.

          my schooling, and a year and a half of searching, I landed my first

          Throughout the years, one gains skills and qualities that help
          construct abilities to be successful at life and survive in the ever
          changing world. Some retained, others not, all add to the learning
          experience, from child to adult life. Listed would be some of those
          qualities that I myself have come across. Some of these have been
          years in the making, others are newely acquired, but all add to up to
          be built upon.

          New concepts are still being learned every day. I have found
          <span class="blue-text">Web Development</span> takes a rediculous
          amount of patience. Mixing this patience, along with learning new
          skills, amounts to more abilities. I am open to, and very interested
          in, any freelance builds, job opportunities or communications. Also,
          feedback of any kind would be greatly valued.
