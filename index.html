          and progressing as a
          <span class="blue-text">Front-End Developer</span> for a little over a
          year now. I most recently started getting into more of the back-end
          concepts, mainly Laravel and what that framework has in hiding. In
          doing so, I hope to merge both front and back-ends to produce solid
          full stack potential.

            >St. Petersburg College</a
          >. I enrolled in the
          <span class="blue-text">Computer Science</span> program to learn how
          to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the
          creation of websites. The creativity of design, potential freedom of
          work schedule, possible income, and change of scenery is what grabbed
          my attention.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          So, after a little experimentaion, I switched my course track to
          accomidate
          <span class="blue-text">Web Development</span>. I had never done, or
          thought about doing, any kind of previous coding. I gravitated towards
          the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a
          solid field to get into. Every business needs a website right? After
          two and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a
          full time work one, I finished my
          <span class="blue-text">Associate in Science</span> and a
          certification as a
          <span class="blue-text">Web Development Specialist</span>. Now I
          pursue it as a new career while still learning this new craft.

                An issue I faced after installing Ubuntu and Mint where Pulse
                Audio would sleep after a short time of silence. When the volume

                briefly. This is a short walkthrough I did to help stop that.

        <p class="content-text">
          I have <span class="blue-text">24 years</span> in the restaurant
          industry, most of which was served with the same company. Back when I
          started in restaurants, I was bussing tables for the first four years
          of my young hospitality life. After a fluke of someone calling in sick
          one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the
          kitchen. I quickly learned all the skills needed, and memorized every
          recipe in order for me to smash through the ranks.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different
          locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten years later, I was
          awarded the first kitchen directly under my management. This first
          stop in my management role was at the
          <span class="blue-text">Brandon, Florida</span> location. My staff and
          I proceeded to set record numbers in multiple categories for the next
          five years while I was there.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          My last stop was
          <span class="blue-text">Sarasota, Florida</span>, where my staff and I
          again set record numbers for the next two years. While doing so, we
          were also a food test kitchen, and one of the top "Manager in
          Training" locations. After two and a half years, I returned to the
          Tampa Bay area and decided to go back to school, attending St.
          Petersburg College.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          After my return, and while attending school, I continued on in kitchen
          work as a lead cook for a country club in
          <span class="blue-text">Countryside, Florida</span>. Upon completing
          my schooling, and a year and a half of searching, I landed my first
          development role as a
          <span class="blue-text">Front-End Developer</span> for a local
          marketing and design group. I am now looking at progressing into the
