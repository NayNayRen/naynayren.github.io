        I returned to school in the Spring of 2016 and began taking classes at
        <a href="https://www.spcollege.edu/" class="spc-link purple-text" target="_blank"
          title="Follow Me To Visit SPC">St. Petersburg College</a>. I enrolled in the
        <span class="blue-text">Computer Science</span> program to learn how
        to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the
        creation of websites. The creativity of design, potential freedom of
        work schedule, possible income, and change of scenery is what grabbed
        my attention.

        After a little experimentaion, I switched my course track to
        accomidate
        <span class="blue-text">Web Development</span>. I had never done, or
        thought about doing, any kind of previous coding. I gravitated towards
        the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a
        solid field to get into. Everybody needs a website right? After two
        and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a
        full time work one, I finished my
        <span class="blue-text">Associate in Science</span> and a
        certification in <span class="blue-text">Web Development</span>. Now I
        pursue it as a new career while also continuing to learn.

        through each slide using the arrows, and if you'd like to visit a
        build, just click on the picture. For the carousel-like effect that
        contains the projects, I used a JavaScript library called

          title="Follow Me To Glider.js">Glider.js</a>. I've toyed with it here and there, but this is the first time
        I've used it in a project. It's extremely lightweight with smooth transitions, and very mobile friendly. It's
        not a true carousel as it doesn't have infinate looping, but it's a really nice alternative.

              an experiment in creating it
              using only a front end stack of HTML,
              CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as a one-user application for
              testing. I was then tasked to rebuild it but using PHP. This
              led me to Laravel, and my intro to a back end framework. This
              also introduced me to the use of phpMyAdmin, MySQL, Model View
              Controller (MVC) concept, Blade Templates, Google Maps API, and a
              re-introduction to jQuery. A lot of what was just mentioned

              An issue I faced after installing Ubuntu and Mint where Pulse
              Audio would sleep after a short time of silence. When the volume
              was adjusted or audio started, the speakers would crack and pop
              briefly. This is a short walkthrough I did to help stop that.

        I have <span class="blue-text">24 years</span> in the restaurant
        industry, most served with the same company. When I
        started in restaurants, I was bussing tables for the first four years
        of my young hospitality life. After a fluke of someone calling in sick
        one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the
        kitchen. I quickly learned all the skills needed to smash through the ranks.

        Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different
        locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten years later, I was
        awarded the first kitchen directly under my management at the
        <span class="blue-text">Brandon, Florida</span> location. My staff and
        I proceeded to set record numbers in multiple categories for the next
        five years while I was there.

        My last stop was
        <span class="blue-text">Sarasota, Florida</span>, where my staff and I
        again set record numbers for the next two years. While doing so, we
        were also a food test kitchen, and one of the top "Manager in
        Training" locations. After two and a half years, I returned to the
        Tampa Bay area and decided to go back to school, attending St.
        Petersburg College.

        my schooling, and a year and a half of searching, I landed my first

        Throughout the years, one gains skills and qualities that help
        construct abilities to be successful at life and survive in the ever
        changing world. Some retained, others not, all add to the learning
        experience, from child to adult life. Listed would be some of those
        qualities that I myself have come across. Some have more use than others, but they all add up in one way or
