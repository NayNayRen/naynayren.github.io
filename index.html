      <p class="container-text">Greetings and hellos, thank you for taking an interest in seeing what I've created here. I just wanted to introduce myself a little before you went on your way through the rest of my site. My name is <span
          class="container-text-colored">Nate Moscato</span>, I am 39 years old, currently residing in Pinellas County, and a front-end developer for roughly 7 months.</p>
      <p class="container-text">My first resume website was originally created in 2018 towards the end of my Associate's degree, parts and pieces of which can be seen reworked here. I am on a journey to grow my creativity in the ways of web design by
        producing manageable, cleanly written code, alongside responsive and intriguing websites. The sections covering my <span class="container-text-colored">Education</span> and <span class="container-text-colored">Projects</span> gives more on my
        schooling and creations.</p>
      <p class="container-text">After 22 years in restaraunts, I thought pursuing something new could be refreshing, and I took to Computer Science, which also started a few hobbies. A more in depth dive into that portion can be found down in my
        <span class="container-text-colored">Work</span> section if you'd
        like. My goal in this is to be successful at creating websites, plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p class="container-text"> Please take a moment to cruise through my site, check out what I have covered through my studies, see some of the projects I've created, read a little of my
        work history, and if you would like to <span class="container-text-colored">Contact</span> me, please do so through any means listed below. There is also a <a href="img/myResume.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">.pdf</a> version of my resume
        if you're interested in that as well. It's located through the link to the left, or down with my media and contact links. My intentions are not to take over the world, but merely to create a comfortable life while building creative and
        engaging products.</p>

    <!-- EDUCATION -->
    <div class="container education">
      <a id="education"></a>
      <h1>Back to the books...</h1>
      <p class="container-text">I returned to school in the Spring of 2016 and began taking classes at <a href="https://www.spcollege.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">St. Petersburg College</a>.
        I enrolled in the Computer Science program to learn how to code. A few semesters in I had my first class involving the creation of
        websites. The creativity of design, potential freedom of work schedule, possible income, and change of scenery is what grabbed my attention.
      </p>
      <span class="container-square"></span>
      <p class="container-text">So, after a little experimentaion, I switched my course track to accomidate <span class="container-text-colored">Web Development</span>. I had never
        done, or thought about doing, any kind of previous coding. I gravitated towards the idea that technology is only gaining traction, and it would be a solid field to get into.
        Every business needs a website right? After two and a half years of a part time class schedule, to go along with a full time work one,
        I finished my <span class="container-text-colored">Associate in Science</span> and a degree in Web Development. Now I pursue it as a new career while still learning this new craft.</p>

      <p class="container-text">So here are a handful of projects that I've built. Page down through each slide, and if you'd like to visit each build, just click the picture. These are school and personal builds that I thought would be a nice
        addition for your viewing pleasure. These were reworks done from originals of mine to somewhat update the look, and make them more responsive to different displays.

      <h1>My history of work...</h1>
      <p class="container-text">I have <span class="container-text-colored">24 years</span> in the restaurant industry, most of which was served with the same company. Back when I started in restaurants, I was bussing tables for the first four years
        of my young hospitality life. After a fluke
        of someone calling in sick one evening, and me filling in for that night, I was moved to the kitchen. I quickly learned all the skills needed, and memorized every recipe in order for me to smash through the ranks.</p>
      <span class="container-square"></span>
      <p class="container-text">Once my skills were up to par, I was moved around to a few different locations as a store opener and trainer. Ten years later, I was awarded the first kitchen directly under my management. This first stop in my
        management role was at the <span class="container-text-colored">Brandon, Florida</span> location. My staff and I proceeded to set record numbers in multiple categories for the next five years while I was there.</p>
      <p class="container-text">My last stop was
        <span class="container-text-colored">Sarasota, Florida</span>, where my staff and I again set record numbers for the next two years. While doing so, we were also a food test kitchen, and one of the top "Manager in Training" locations. After
        two and a half years, I returned to the Tampa
        Bay area and decided to go back to school, attending St. Petersburg College.
      </p>
      <p class="container-text">After my return, and while attending school, I continued on in kitchen work as a lead cook for a country club in <span class="container-text-colored">Countryside, Florida</span>. Upon completing my schooling, and a
        year and a half of searching, I landed my first development role as a Front-End Developer for a local marketing and design group.</p>
